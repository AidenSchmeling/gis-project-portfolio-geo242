For example, if an area goes from low density urban to high density urban we would naturally expect there to be more renting than owning due to the typical makeup of high density urban environments. The same is true for regions that experience change from rural, or non-populated regions to sub-urban area, these new constructions are more likely to be owned than rented.\n",
